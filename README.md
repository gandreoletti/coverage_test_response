# coverage_test_response

This is the response to the coverage_test mock test.

The task consisted in:

Generate a report that lists any genes that have less than 100% coverage at 30x. Note that the sambamba output lists coverage by exon and these will need to be amalgamated to generate a list of genes that do not meet the coverage requirement.

Ideally using python, write a script that takes the sambamba output and generates a report listing any genes that have less than 100% coverage at 30x
This script should be able to be applied to any gene panel
